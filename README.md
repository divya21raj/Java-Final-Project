## About the Project
Cab-pooling is a huge concern in an isolated, residential university like Shiv Nadar University. It has become a part of the process while planning to go anywhere. Although Gmail is an easy platform for cab-pool requests, it is not convenient at all because of the following reasons,
1. Important messages might get lost in a flood of cab-pool mails.
2. It is essentially a spam message for people who do not want to cab-pool.
3. You require the mailing list to send cab-pool requests, or reply all to an existing thread which is a slow process.
4. It is not easy to keep a track of people interested in your offer unless they message you on Whatsapp or call.
5. Privacy is a huge concern, as you do not want to share your number out there in the public.

In such a scenario, there is a need for such an app which will be secure, and easy to use at the same time. UniPool does the exact same thing.
